This is going to be a library that simplifies the process of making neural networks in C or C++, similarly to how tensorflow does it in Python.
I'm mostly doing this to practice and strengthen my understanding, but I also really dislike the C support that tensorflow 2 offers, so I'm making my own
in case I ever have to work with neural networks in C. This is the initial commit so I'm not gonna write anything else, but wish me luck.
